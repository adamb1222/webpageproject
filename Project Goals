Steps to take to integrate issues into our workflow and start on Web Page Project


GOALS: Today we’ll group project repo to get started to build our web pages
Create group project repo, add collaborators 
Identify keywords to divide and conquer, design, outline etc.
Create issues in GitHub to build keyword docs, design.txt, outline.txt, etc.
Select a unique issue and assign it to ourselves.
Clone the repo to your desktop and create a branch for your work (outline-initial, etc)
Create your keyword doc, design.txt and place info in it.
Add the file, and  commit using keywords, “closes #2” for example for issue 2
Push the change and create a pull request so another on your team can merge your info
After the info is merged, delete the branch
